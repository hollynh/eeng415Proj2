# eeng415Proj2
Project 2 for EENG 415: Data Science for Electrical Engineers
This project uses applies clustering and classification techniques to divide and classify a group of hypothetical utility customers based on their energy consumption patterns, using a dataset from the National Renewable Energy Labratory, available through the Research Support Facility,in Golden, CO. This project utilized the building net hourly values from the given dataset and designated each 24 hour interval as one hypothetical "customer". My group decided on a set of attributes that could be pulled from each time series customer instance to describe a total of 365 hypothetical customers.

Along with the MATLAB code and dataset containing the customers and their attributes, this repository includes our final paper, which describes this project in detail with its results.
